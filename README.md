# Gasifier Flame Temperature Estimation

Welcome to the Gasifier Flame Temperature Estimation project repository! üå°Ô∏èüî•

## Overview

This project explores an innovative approach to estimate the temperature of a gasifier flame using color analysis. In the absence of direct temperature measurement instruments, we leverage image processing techniques to gain insights into the combustion dynamics.

## Features

- **Color Analysis:** Utilizes OpenCV and Matplotlib to process gasifier flame images and generate a color spectrum histogram.
- **Innovative Mapping:** Maps hue values to RGB colors of the visible spectrum for a visual representation of the flame's color distribution.
- **Temperature Estimation:** Introduces a placeholder calibration function for estimating temperatures in Kelvin.
- **Step-by-Step Procedure:** Detailed instructions on running the Python code and analyzing the color spectrum.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python matplotlib
  ```

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aldrenjarilla/RGHSTempEstimate.git
   cd RGHSTempEstimate
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python spectogram.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Procedure:**
   - Open the script in your favorite text editor.
   - Optional: Replace the image path in the script or follow the prompts to select an image.
   - Analyze the generated color spectrum histogram and temperature estimates.

## Contribute

- Explore further calibration and experimentation.
- Share your insights and ideas in the Discussions section.
